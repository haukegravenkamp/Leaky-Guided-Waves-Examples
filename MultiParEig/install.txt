Installation the MultiParEig toolbox
---------------------------------------

1. Unpack the compressed file MultiParEig.zip. This should create
   a directory MultiParEig.

2. Open MATLAB and change into the directory MultiParEig.

3. Execute the following commands within Matlab

     addpath(pwd)
     cd examples; cd bdemep; addpath(pwd)
     savepath %<-- Save path for future MATLAB sessions.
              %    This may not work for all installations of Matlab.

Compatibility with MATLAB versions
----------------------------------

This toolbox requires MATLAB Version 8.0 (R2012b) or later. It has
been tested under Windows 7 and Windows 10, with MATLAB 8.0 (R2012b), and 8.5 (R2015a)

Other requierements
-------------------

If you use MATLAB prior to Version 8.3 (R2014a), package lapack by T. Toolan is recommended for faster evaluation of twopareigs.
Some functions support extended precision using 'mp' type from Multiprecision Computing Toolbox, http://www.advanpix.com/, see examples in directory Multiprecision.

Getting started
---------------

Run the functions that start with demo_ in Examples subdirectories

Additional information
----------------------

This is a joined work with Andrej Muhiè, who wrote part of the code, among other things he contributed the staircase algorithm for a singular multiparameter eigenvalue problem.
