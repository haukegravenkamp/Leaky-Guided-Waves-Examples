## Leaky Guided Waves Examples

This repository includes codes to compute dispersion curves and mode shapes of elastic waves in plate structures that are coupled to unbounded fluid or solid media on either or both surfaces.

Specifically, the codes reproduce the numerical examples published in 
Gravenkamp, Hauke, Bor Plestenjak, Daniel A Kiefer, and Elias Jarlebring. “Computation of Leaky Waves in Layered Structures Coupled to Unbounded Media by Exploiting Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problems.” Journal of Sound And Vibration, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2024.118716.
